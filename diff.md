_Chris gets expelled from James Woods High because he has the lowest test scores in the entire school. The family visits a few different institutions but none that seem to work for Chris.  Lois' father, Carter, then gets Chris admitted to a fancy private academy, but he doesn't fit in with the rest of the students._
