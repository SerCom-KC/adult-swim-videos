_Bob worries he's depriving his children of their summer vacation by making them work at the restaurant, so he fires them. However, the kids become so bored with their newfound freedom that they secretly get hired by a pair of married hippie farmers, who hire the Belcher kids as "weed pickers." Meanwhile, Bob hires Mickey the bank robber to help out at the restaurant, but soon regrets his decision._
