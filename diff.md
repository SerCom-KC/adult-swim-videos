_Dr. Venture's therapy group, a collection of former Boy Adventurers (who have become failed adults), quickly fall back into their old habits when a mystery is literally dropped into their session.  Meanwhile, Sgt. Hatred tries to overcome his own past when he's stuck in a movie theater crammed with kids. History is doomed to keep repeating itself if Hatred and Dr. Venture can't break their cycles. Part of Season 4._
