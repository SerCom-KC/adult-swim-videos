_When Yukio takes on a case, Rin tags along with him to the Exorcism Supply Shop. There he meets Shiemi, a girl with ailing legs, tending to her garden. Shiemi seems devoted to this garden, as it was left to her by her late grandmother. Just then, Yukio shows up to examine Shiemi's legs. Finding demonic traces, he speculates that the garden is the cause._
