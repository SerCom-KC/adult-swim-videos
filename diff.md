_In homage to the “Bronies” subculture, Tina attends her first Equestra-Con, a convention based on her favorite animated pony show, “The Equestranauts.” To her surprise, she finds that the show’s fans are middle-aged men (called “Equesticles”). When a powerful super-fan tricks Tina out of her rare toy pony, it’s up to Bob to go undercover to get it back._

_To Tina's delight, Bob becomes the substitute "Home Ec" teacher at her school and ends up creating a full-scale restaurant in the classroom. However, her excitement is short-lived as Bob's position causes father/daughter friction. But when Gene and Louise go to work for Bob's "school" restaurant, Linda must fend for herself at the family's other restaurant (aka Bob's Burgers)._
