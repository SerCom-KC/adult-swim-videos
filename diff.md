_If you loved "The Color Purple," and can't get enough of "Precious," we present an equally powerful, emotionally gripping story of people senselessly beating on each other. Uncle Ruckus's family comes to town and Ruckus must settle some old business with his father. It's a tale of abuse, and triumph, and... actually no, it's just a tale of abuse._
