_Always short on cash, Dr. Venture decides to unload some of his father's old scientific equipment in a huge yard sale that attracts fellow scientists and super-villains alike. Everyone is supposed to be on their best behavior, but The Monarch can't resist the temptation to wreak havoc once he finds himself inside the "belly of the beast"... nor can he find a bathroom._
