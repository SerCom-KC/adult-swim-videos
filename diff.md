_Gene, Louise, and Tina discover a seaweed-covered object at the beach that turns out to be a large hunk of Ambergris - an extremely valuable, but illegal, byproduct of whale poop that is used in high-end perfumes - and Louise tries to cheat Gene and Tina out of the profit she hopes to make by selling the treasure on the black market. Meanwhile, Bob and Linda deal with their psychologically unstable landlord who is building them a new bathroom._

_In homage to the “Bronies” subculture, Tina attends her first Equestra-Con, a convention based on her favorite animated pony show, “The Equestranauts.” To her surprise, she finds that the show’s fans are middle-aged men (called “Equesticles”). When a powerful super-fan tricks Tina out of her rare toy pony, it’s up to Bob to go undercover to get it back._

_To Tina's delight, Bob becomes the substitute "Home Ec" teacher at her school and ends up creating a full-scale restaurant in the classroom. However, her excitement is short-lived as Bob's position causes father/daughter friction. But when Gene and Louise go to work for Bob's "school" restaurant, Linda must fend for herself at the family's other restaurant (aka Bob's Burgers)._
