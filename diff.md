_A news item about Django, the little monkey whose brain was transplanted into a robot body, plunges the crew into a lengthy debate on whether or not they would allow their brains to be put in robot bodies. Meanwhile, Sealab is in imminent danger of imploding, and Dr. Quinn is the only one onboard who seems to care._

_No one will play with Captain Murphy. Bored and dejected, he starts a pirate radio station using Sealab's emergency radio beacon. As "Howling Mad" Murphy, his obnoxious humor (and soundtrack by The Knaves) catapults him to stardom. But the FCC is closing in on his signal--and this time, it's personal._
