_Crushed by her failure to save her best friend, Paku, Izumo turns on Suguro in a burst of rage! Their bickering escalates until the whole cram school is involved, and they're all sent to detention together. Rin and the others are forced to endure long hours of holding low-level demons on their laps. Just then, the lights go out, and the students are attacked by the ghoul that Rin thought he'd repulsed the day before!_
