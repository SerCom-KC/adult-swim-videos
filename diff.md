_With Moltar on the run, suspense dominates this episode, from its Martin Quinn Production open to its "Charlie's Angels"-inspired cutaways and faux-spy drama epilogue. Space Ghost is forced to recruit Tansut as his fill-in director, who causes problems before bringing out guests Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield of Metallica._
