_Brock Samson is a marked man. Terminated from the O.S.I., stripped of his license to kill, and hunted by three of the world's deadliest assassins, Brock only has one thing left:  The Venture family.  And he wants them as far away from him as they can get. But not even Molotov Cocktease, Hunter Gathers and a friendly pair of ex-O.S.I. comrades can sever the ties that bind. And The Monarch and Sgt. Hatred certainly aren't helping._
