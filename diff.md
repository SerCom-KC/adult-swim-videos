_When Peter bumps into Death at The Drunken Clam one evening, he gets nostalgic about what it would be like to relive his life as an 18-year old.  Death grants him this wish and Peter and Brian are sent back to 1984 where they meet up with Cleveland, Quagmire, Joe and Lois in hip 80's styles. While visiting the past, Peter screws up his present day, now married to Molly Ringwald while Lois has a family with Quagmire._
