_After a power outage in Quahog, Peter Griffin tells his family the greatest story every told, "Star Wars IV: A New Hope".  "Family Guy" parodies the tale of Luke Skywalker (Chris Griffin) on his path to aid the rebellion. Along with his companions, R2D2 (Cleveland), C-3PO (Quagmire), Han Solo (Peter), Chewbacca (Brian), and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Herbert), Luke infiltrates the Death Star to rescue Princess Leia (Lois) from the clutches of Darth Vader (Stewie).  After a daring escape, the rebellion attacks and eventually destroys the Death Star._
