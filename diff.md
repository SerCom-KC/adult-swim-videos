_The class's latest mission is to search for a "ghost" spotted in an amusement park. Paired up with Shiemi, Rin can't shake off the feeling that he's on a date. They find the ghost, who keeps taunting them and running off, until the mission becomes a game of tag. Separated from Shiemi, Rin is confronted by the King of Earth - Amaimon! When he loses the Koma Sword to Amaimon, Rin finds himself being consumed by the power of Satan...!_
