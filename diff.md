_After striking out with yet another lady, Brian attempts to reconnect with his only true love, Tracy Flannigan.  He and Stewie visit this past love but find out that the years have not been kind to Tracy. She tells Brian that the two of them had a love child named Dylan, who has grown to be a complete delinquent. Tracy then sends Dylan to live with Brian and the Griffin family but Dylan's unruly behavior causes Brian to step up as a father figure. With this guidance, he becomes a model student._
