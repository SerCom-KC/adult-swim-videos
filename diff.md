_On a scientific expedition in the Bermuda Triangle, Doc's experimental equipment awakens and possibly enrages the submerged ghost of Major Tom, a test pilot who crashed in an experimental aircraft designed by Doc's father.  While there, the Ventures' hydrofoil is hijacked by a group of fake ghost pirates who've been stranded in the sargassum since Jesus Jones was popular._
