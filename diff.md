_Composer/Musician Dan Deacon (Bromst, America) teams up with Director/Editor Dave Hughes (Off The Air/Adult Swim) to create a 22 minute music video odyssey that takes viewers on a skewed trip through the American landscape and beyond. The music is the four part USA suite, off Deacon's latest album America, and the visuals were culled from artists all over the world._
