He and Stewie visit this past love but find out that the years have not been kind to Tracy. She tells Brian that the two of them had a love child named Dylan, who has grown to be a complete delinquent. Tracy then sends Dylan to live with Brian and the Griffin family but Dylan's unruly behavior causes Brian to step up as a father figure. With this guidance, he becomes a model student.",
