The truths and half-truths about Dr. Venture's former arch nemeses, Dr. Girlfriend and The Monarch, are finally revealed (albeit obliquely) in an episode spanning twenty years... and oceans of love. See how they first met, their first kiss, their first trembling gropes... at supervillainy--and what The Guild of Calamitous Intent has to say about it all.",

Terminated from the O.S.I., stripped of his license to kill, and hunted by three of the world's deadliest assassins, Brock only has one thing left:  The Venture family.  And he wants them as far away from him as they can get. But not even Molotov Cocktease, Hunter Gathers and a friendly pair of ex-O.S.I. comrades can sever the ties that bind. And The Monarch and Sgt. Hatred certainly aren't helping.",
