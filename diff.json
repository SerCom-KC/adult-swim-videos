But it's okay, because rich white Mr. Phil Drummond and his rich white friends adopt all the orphans at once and whisk them off to a luxury high-rise in the sky. Just as BD comes to terms with no longer having the Orphans around, he learns that luxury skyscraper is actually a deathmatch arena where the Orphans fight each other to the death for food! He's got to put an end to these Hunger Pang Games, no matter how popular they are!",

Inflamed, the beast kidnaps Bee and takes her to the top of Watts Towers, where neither the old-ass Tuskegee Airmen, nor Black Dynamite's trademark kung fu are enough to rescue her.",
