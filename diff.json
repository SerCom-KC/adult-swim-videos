To cheer her up, Black Dynamite takes her to the circus where she finds a most unlikely admirer in the main attraction: a giant albino ape named Honky Kong! Inflamed, the beast kidnaps Bee and takes her to the top of Watts Towers, where neither the old-ass Tuskegee Airmen, nor Black Dynamite's trademark kung fu are enough to rescue her.",

Just as BD comes to terms with no longer having the Orphans around, he learns that luxury skyscraper is actually a deathmatch arena where the Orphans fight each other to the death for food!
