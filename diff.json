Quagmire is pulled away from his friends leaving them all distraught.  He soon realizes that he's made a mistake.  The boys launch a plan to get Quagmire out of his marriage by faking his own death. Meanwhile, Stewie becomes possessive of Lois as she attempts to wean him off of her breast milk.  Just as he kicks his addiction to his mother, she confesses that she has missed their bonding.",
